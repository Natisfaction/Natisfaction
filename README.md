### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate young coder who loves to work with different programming languages such as Python, Java, and more.
Although I enjoy using high-level languages, low-level languages such as Assembly and C are my favorites. I find them more thrilling to work with because they allow me to have more control over the code I write, even if it means creating most of the libraries from scratch.

I often remember spending my afternoons coding simple games like the Tris game or creating small programs that automate OS tasks or help with decision making when I was younger.

However, my coding journey took a turn when I challenged myself to create an OS from scratch.
I remember waking up one Sunday morning, wondering if I could create one.
It was a time-consuming task that required extensive research and learning. Despite this, I did manage to create a really basic OS called NaitOS.
While it's not perfect and still requires some refactoring, I'm really proud of what I accomplished so far. I'm no longer coding it, because I recently teamed up with a friend, and we decided to create another OS, this time using UEFI to make it simpler and newer. And now, due to my better coding experience, I should be able to make the new OS better.

Will we be able to code the new OS??? Only time will tell.
